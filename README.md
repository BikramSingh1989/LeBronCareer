 As an avid LeBron fan I wanted the ability to reference his career accolades 
 I wanted to be able to access his stats easily 
 It solves the problem of having to search for individual stats and have the stats readily available in one space
 I learned the process of patience as this project required a lot of revision and fixing errors
